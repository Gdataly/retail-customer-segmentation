# Retail Customer Segmentation Analysis 🛍️

## Project Overview 🎯
A data science project that analyzes customer behavior in retail/e-commerce using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and machine learning. This solution helps businesses understand their customer base and create targeted marketing strategies.

### Business Value
- Identify high-value customers
- Optimize marketing spend through targeted campaigns
- Reduce customer churn
- Increase customer lifetime value
- Improve inventory management

## Features ⭐
- Customer segmentation using RFM analysis
- Machine learning-based clustering
- Interactive visualizations
- Automated reporting
- Segment-specific recommendations

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Key Libraries:**
  - pandas: Data manipulation
  - scikit-learn: Machine learning
  - matplotlib/seaborn: Visualization
  - numpy: Numerical operations

## Analysis Components 📊
1. **RFM Analysis**
   - Recency: Time since last purchase
   - Frequency: Number of purchases
   - Monetary: Total spending

2. **Customer Segments**
   - High-Value Loyal Customers
   - Mid-Value Regular Customers
   - Recent Active Customers
   - At-Risk Customers

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pip
virtualenv (optional)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-customer-segmentation.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd retail-customer-segmentation

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage Example
```python
from src.data_processing.data_generator import RetailDataGenerator
from src.analysis.segmentation import CustomerSegmentation

# Generate sample data
generator = RetailDataGenerator()
transactions_df = generator.generate_data()

# Perform segmentation
segmentation = CustomerSegmentation(transactions_df)
segments = segmentation.analyze()
```

## Results and Insights 📈

### Customer Segment Distribution
- High-Value Loyal: 15%
- Mid-Value Regular: 30%
- Recent Active: 25%
- At Risk: 20%
- Low-Value Irregular: 10%

### Key Findings
1. High-value customers generate 40% of revenue
2. At-risk segment shows 15% churn rate
3. Recent customers have 60% conversion rate

## Business Recommendations 💡
